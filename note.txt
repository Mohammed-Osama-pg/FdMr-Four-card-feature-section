## What the challenge?
    It is a layout-based challenge for beginners. This will test anyone who is new to multi-column and responsive layouts.

## What it requires ?
    Basic knowlege of Flex box and font flowed wille not forget of html strucure and using SASS for style.

## Ideas to test myself :
- Write your styles using a pre-processor, such as Sass, Less or Stylus
- Train your eye for detail by getting your solution as close to the design as you can
- Try estimating the time it will take for you to build the project. Then see if the time taken matches up to your estimate. Project estimations are a skill that is often overlooked but is essential for professional developers.
